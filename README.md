# HammingEncoderDecoder
This encodes 11 bits of data into a 16 bit hamming encoded code word, and can also decode the 16 bits back into the original data with error correction.
This project was coded entirely in MIPS Assembly Language and can be run using QtSpim.
Check out the 'Hamming Encoder_Decoder.pdf' file for a flowchart and screenshots of it's operation.
